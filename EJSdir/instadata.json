      "bio": "In the past, mostly in Egypt, people kept cats because the cats hunted and ate mice and rats. The oldest evidence of cats kept as pets is from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, around 7500 BC. Ancient Egyptians worshipped cats as gods, and often mummified them so they could be with their owners 'for all of eternity'.Today, people often keep cats as pets. There are also domestic cats which live without being cared for by people. These cats are called 'feral cats' or 'stray cats'.The cats started becoming pets when the Egyptians were around.",
